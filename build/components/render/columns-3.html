        <p>If, however, a computer game involves multiple players, then delving into the program&#x27;s internals can enable one to truly cheat, in the sense that one gains an unfair advantage over the other players, an advantage moreover of which they may be unaware. Habitat is such a multi-player game. When we were designing the software, our &quot;prime directive&quot; was, &quot;The backend shall not assume the validity of anything a player computer tells it.&quot; This is because we needed to protect ourselves against the possibility that a clever user had hacked around with his copy of the frontend program to add &quot;custom features&quot;. For example, we could not implement any of the sort of &quot;skill and action&quot; elements found in traditional video games wherein dexterity with the joystick determines the outcome of, say, armed combat, because you couldn&#x27;t guard against someone modifying their copy of the program to tell the backend that they had &quot;hit&quot;, whether they actually had or not. Indeed, our partners at QuantumLink warned us of this very eventuality before we even started -- they already had users who did this sort of thing with their regular system. Would anyone actually go to the trouble of disassembling and studying 100K or so of incredibly tight and bizarrely threaded 6502 machine code just to tinker? As it turns out, the answer is yes. People did. We were not 100% rigorous in following our own rule. It turned out that there were a few features whose implementation was greatly eased by breaking the rule in situations where, in our judgment, the consequences would not be material if some people &quot;cheated&quot; by hacking their own systems. Darned if some people didn&#x27;t hack their systems to cheat in exactly these ways. Care must be taken in the design of the world as well. One incident that occurred during our pilot test involved a small group of players exploiting a bug in our world database which they interpreted as a feature. First, some background. Avatars were hatched with 2000 Tokens in their bank account, and each day that they logged in the received another 100T. Avatars could acquire additional funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried treasure, and so on. They could spend their Tokens on, among other things, various items for sale in vending machines called Vendroids. There were also Pawn Machines, which would buy objects back (at a discount, of course).</p>
